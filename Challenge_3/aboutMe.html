    <p>My name is Stephen. I graduated from University at Albany with my B.S in Computer Science. I was the Center Director for theCoderSchool. At theCoderSchool I oversaw the coaches and also taught students from 7 - 18 years old how to program. During my time there I honed my skills as a developer by being able to teach necessary foundational programming skills to students.</p>
